# My Angular Calendar

MyCalendar is a feature-rich calendar application built with Angular. It allows users to manage their appointments and events efficiently with different views (day, week, month). The application supports drag-and-drop functionality for easy rescheduling of appointments and provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and editing events.

## Features

- **Multiple Views**: Switch between day, week, and month views to see your appointments in different layouts.
- **Appointment Management**: Add, edit, and delete appointments with ease.
- **Drag and Drop**: Use drag-and-drop functionality to reschedule appointments quickly.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
npm run ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
npm run ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
